A pigeon focused, turn based multiplayer strategy game where you attack, defend, and steal food  from rival pigeons.

#### Gaming Motivations
A light and funny game to experience with friends or strangers that can become competitive. The players compete to last the longest in the round and gain status if they win.

#### Player Experience Goals
It will be easy to learn with simple game play which is essentially an upgraded rock paper scissors. Although it starts out random, players can win bonus lives or special moves that they will have to use wisely to win the game.

## Game Concept
Imagine you are a pigeon living in the big city. People drop food left and right, hot dog stands dropping dogs off the carts - there's a plethora or food to scavenge for. However, under the surface, these spots are the grounds for pigeon warfare. Under the hood, it’s a bloody battle for crumbs. Who’s gonna get that dog?

#### Game bjectives
The objective of the game is to last for all the rounds or until the other player loses all its lives first. The board is basically split into three rows with however many columns(rounds). Each row represents a body part so head, torso, legs. Every pigeon starts with the same amount of lives and the same number of defenses and attacks. Players have a timer for each round where they will set their defenses and attacks but there is a limited amount so they must be strategic to predict moves and/or force the other player's hand. If an attack hits an undefended area, then that player loses a life. If you win the game, you can purchase items at the grocery store such as new skins, attacks and other bonus material to use in games.

#### Gameplay Progression
A hot dog drops to the floors, two pigeons fly in and the board appears. Round 1 timer starts and you have a certain number of hours to make your move. Once you have decided on your strategy, you just click on the attack or defense that you want on a certain section(head, torso, or body).  When the timer runs out, each player's moves will be revealed. The undefended player loses a life and whoever  runs out of lives first loses.

#### Additional Features and Elements
Bonus lives, speed up time, robotic parts,  special attacks, calling reinforcements, hidden bombs, stealing moves or peek at the other plays moves are all possible add ons that can be won through special combinations such as 3 round wins in a row or bought at the grocery store. We could implement a simple chat feature to leave threatening messages to the rival pigeons.
